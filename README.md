# XIV Inventory

I've held a fondness for the FFXIV interface for years and back in highschool I decided to try and recreate it during classtime. We were all issued chromebooks so HTML was the only way I could find to make projects outside and this is well before I knew anything about OOP or frameworks so everything is hardcoded and held together by hopes, dreams, and webkit gradients. I find it quite charming
