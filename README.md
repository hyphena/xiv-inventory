# XIV Inventory

I've had a fondness for the FFXIV interface for years and I decided to try and recreate the inventory system back in highschool during my classes when I was supposed to be paying attention. This is well before I knew anything about OOP and components so everything is hardcoded and held together by hopes and dreams. I find it charming lol
